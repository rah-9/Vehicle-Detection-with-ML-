# Real-time Object Detection with YOLOv5n6u

This project demonstrates real-time object detection using the YOLOv5n6u model. The model is configured to run on a low-resolution copy of video frames for faster inference, and detections are drawn on the original high-resolution frames. The project supports processing both YouTube video streams and local video files.

## Features

- **Real-time Object Detection:** Efficiently detect objects in live video streams or local video files.
- **Low-Resolution Inference:** Perform inference on low-resolution frames for speed, while drawing detections on the original high-resolution frames.
- **YouTube and Local Video Support:** Process video from YouTube streams or local video files.

## Installation

To run this project, ensure you have Python and the necessary libraries installed. You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install opencv-python-headless numpy gradio torch yt-dlp ultralytics
